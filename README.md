IO pin wiring (RX on GPIO15, TX on GPIO2)

A1 threshold → Relay1 ON/OFF (with hysteresis) + “log on change”

A2 threshold → transmit learned RF

Learning via UI button or DI1 (Relay8 shows learning window)

10-second pulse on Relay2 when any stored keyfob (up to 16 slots) is heard

16-slot RC code book (save / transmit / clear from web UI)

Slot status lines (Empty or bits/code)

UI sliders for RF Repeat and Pulse Length

Safe on_boot turning Relay2 off
